How create dumps
=================

Rudy's patch is modifying 3 "files":
1) VMM.VXD itself - part of VMM32.VXD (on installed system and in installation archives)
2) VCACHE.VXD - could by part of VMM32.VXD (usually on installed system) or standalone file (installation archives).
3) VMM32.VXD loader - there is coff program in VMM32.VXD that is responsible for loading drivers into memory.

When Patchmem is applied, automatically creates backup. To create dumps to compares, you need these files:

VMM.VXD + VMM.BAK:
- Windows 95 (any edition)
- Windows 98 FE (unpatched)
- Windows Me (unpatched)
- Windows Me + patch Q296773

VCACHE.VXD + VCACHE.BAK:
- Windows 95 (any edition)
- Windows 98 (any edition)
- Windows Me

VMM32.VXD + VMM32.BAK:
- Windows 95 (any edition)
- Windows 98 (any edition)

You need also strip MZ (COFF) stub from these file likely:
patcher9x --mz-strip VMM.VXD vmm95.fix
patcher9x --mz-strip VMM.BAK vmm95.org
(*.org files are stripped version of original files, *.fix are patched ones)

Special case is VMM32 archive when we need only DOS program at the beginning:
patcher9x --mz-strip --dump VMM32.VXD w3_95.fix
patcher9x --mz-strip --dump VMM32.BAK w3_95.org

One important thing: VMM32.VXD needs to be in W3 format (not compressed). To convert it from W4 format (compressed) you can do by:
patcher9x --vxd-convert -force-w3 VMM32.VXD

If you not sure, you can safely run this command on W3 files - when file size grown up, it was W4 file.

Following these instruction you should create these files in 'dump' folder:
- vcache95.fix
- vcache98.fix
- vcacheme.fix
- vmm95.fix
- vmm98.fix
- vmm98fe.fix (98 first edition)
- vmmme.fix
- vmmme_q296773.fix (ME + Q296773)
- w3_95.fix
- w3_98.fix
- vcache95.org
- vcache98.org
- vcacheme.org
- vmm95.org
- vmm98.org
- vmm98fe.org (98 first edition)
- vmmme.org
- vmmme_q296773.org (ME + Q296773)
- w3_95.org
- w3_98.org


At the end run `make soliddiff` to regenerate .h files
