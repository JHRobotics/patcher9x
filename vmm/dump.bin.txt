If you want obtain dump.bin you need:
1) VMM32.VXD from instalation (from instalation NOT from windows/system directory),
   it is by default packed in CABs. If you look at position 0x10000, there should be magic
   "W3" (0x57 0x33). If there is "W4", that file is packed and you must use alternate
   way to optain dump.
-- or --
2) Extracted VMM.VXD, to extract you can use "this" tool:
   (patcher9x -wx-extract <path_to_vmm32.vxd> -o VMM.VXD)
   second option is DOS utility VXDLIB from here:

Search for (HEX): 56 57 8B 74 24 0C 8A 56 02 F6 C2 80
For Windows 98 SE it is on 0x2EE70 (VMM32.VXD) od 0x1EAF0 (VMM.VXD)

Copy from this position exactly 1040 bytes and save to dump.bin

On most unix system you could do that:
- search in file
  $ LANG=C grep -obUaP '\x56\x57\x8B\x74\x24\x0C\x8A\x56\x02\xF6\xC2\x80' VMM.VXD
  result: something like: 125680:VW??t?????$
- copy segment from file
  $ dd if=VMM.VXD bs=1 skip=125680 count=1040 of=dump.bin
