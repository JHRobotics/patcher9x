# Patch for Windows 98/Me to fix TLB invalidation bug

MS Windows 98 won't run on newer CPU (even in virtual machine) due to "TLB invalidation bug".
The Bug is described there: https://blog.stuffedcow.net/2015/08/win9x-tlb-invalidation-bug/

If you want run Virtual Machine without restriction with Windows 98 on AMD Zen 2 and newer (Ryzen 3000+)
or Intel Core 11th generation and newer (code names Rocket Lake, Tiger Lake) you probably need this patch.

## Requirements

Currently supported operations system:

- Windows 98
- Windows 98 SE
- Windows ME

This patch primary targets on **Windows 98** / **Windows 98 SE**. Windows 95 probably hasn't this bug, but has another named
"CPU speed limit", there is patch for it: [Windows 95 patch](http://www.tmeeco.eu/9X4EVER/GOODIES/FIX95CPU_V3_FINAL.ZIP).
Windows 98 FE (First Edition) and Windows 98 Beta releases has same bug as Windows 95 too.

Pathed code for **Windows Me** is present too, if you want install it on Me, call program with `-millennium` argument.
```
patcher9x -millennium
```

Fixed code for Windows Me isn't still very well tested. Because from my observation, the system calls this code very rarely
(for example with driver install/system update).

Some Millennium updates installs new VMM.VXD file - KB 296773 (ME296773.exe). Patch is compatible with this update, but
after updating you need to install the patch again.

## Updating

If you already applied this patch, you don't need install update - currently all changes are for patcher program,
the patched code is same.

## Download

Binary files and bootable floppy image are in [Releases](https://github.com/JHRobotics/patcher9x/releases/)

IMA file is bootable floppy (FREEDOS) usable in virtual machine to simple boot and patch installed system.
Binaries for win32 are Windows 98 compatible, so can be run from safe mode (Hold CTRL on start-up). Binaries
for other system are for create patched installation (in theory you can mount virtual HDD image and patch installed
system on it but do it using boot floppy is much simple).

## Installation

Simplest way is download bootable floppy image. After boot (you will see `A:\`) run
```
patch9x
```
Patch will be run in interactive mode and the default strategy (extract `VMM.VXD` from `VMM32.VMX` and apply patch)
is probably best way. After reboot operation system could start successfully.

### Patching installation media
Copy content of win98 folder from CD / extract it from ISO image. Run 
```
patcher9x /path/to/folder/win98
```
If patch success you can copy file `VMM32.VXD` back to image. Windows installer primary takes files from
installation folder and if it not found them it'll scan CAB archives.

**Please note, that file `VMM32.VXD` from installation IS NOT SAME as file in `Windows/system` folder.
  Don't interchange them! See _Patching process_ section to know more about VMM files.**

## Build from source

For build from source you need:
- GNU C compiler compatible C compiler (minimal version 4.6, MinGW or DJGPP works)
- Flat assemler (https://flatassembler.net/)
- GNU Make (minimal version 3.81)

For building binary for your computer simply type
```
make
```

For cross compiling type specify `HOST_CC` and `GUEST_CC` variables to choose compiler, for example
cross compiling for 32bit Windows:
```
make HOST_CC=gcc GUEST_CC=mingw-w64-i686-gcc
```

For producing production binary pass `RELEASE=1` to `make`.

Afrer compile you can strip binary (reduce some space) by
```
make strip
```

There is special profile for DOS cross-compilation, if you have DJGPP compiler, you can produce
DOS executable this way:
```
make RELEASE=1 PROFILE=djgpp
make strip
```

**Executable file name for most real operation systems called `patcher9x`. For dos called `patch9x.exe`
  because file names are limited to 8+3 characters.**

## Patching proccess

Patch self is relative simple - injecting 2 instruction (`mov ecx,cr3` and `mov cr3,ecx`) to code
in `VMM.VXD` driver. Patch totally modifies 29 bytes in this file.

Problem is that file `VMM.VXD` isn't on normal state on HDD.

File `VMM.VXD` if part of `VMM32.VXD` which is compressed archive of more `VXD` drivers. File `VMM32.VXD`
isn't generic but is generated by installer exclusively for your HW configuration.

System for loading drivers looks first in `SYSTEM\VMM32` folder, and if driver isn't there, then it will
search in `VMM32.VXD` file.

## Development

In future I would like include patch "CPU speed limit" (95, 98 FE) and patch 48-bit LBA (95, 98, ME).
